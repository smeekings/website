I'm a speech neuroscience researcher trying to figure out how human voices work. I'm currently supported by a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship, hosted by the University of York.

I want to understand how the brain produces everyday conversational interactions in neurotypical talkers and people with speech production difficulties. I also want to understand how having an atypical voice affects everyday interactions and employment outcomes. My work looks at neural, acoustic, and social components of speech interaction in typical speakers and people who have a neurological condition affecting their speech, such as stuttering or Tourette Syndrome.
